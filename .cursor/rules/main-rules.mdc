# Main Rules to always follow

- ALWAYS check the /Docs directory. I have stored Roblox API Documentation and Lua Language Documentation to always check. Always analyze and deeply understand these files before answering. 

They are in these files:
[Advanced_Lua_RobloxDoc.md](mdc:Docs/Advanced_Lua_RobloxDoc.md)
[Overview of Roblox APIs.md](mdc:Docs/Overview of Roblox APIs.md)
[Roblox_API_Doc1.md](mdc:Docs/Roblox_API_Doc1.md)
[Roblox_Lua_Features_Report_ReplicatedStorage_HTTP_Loadstring.md](mdc:Docs/Roblox_Lua_Features_Report_ReplicatedStorage_HTTP_Loadstring.md)

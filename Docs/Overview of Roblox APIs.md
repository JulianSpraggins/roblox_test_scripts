## Overview of Roblox APIs

Roblox exposes several APIs that can be used to interact with its services and resources. They can be broadly classified into:

- **Web/Legacy APIs:** These endpoints are used for account management, catalog browsing, localization, groups, and messaging, among others. They are hosted on various subdomains (such as accountinformation.roblox.com, games.roblox.com, etc.) and are often relied upon by external tools and communities.  
- **Cloud (Open Cloud) APIs:** These are modern, fully RESTful endpoints that allow you to access Roblox resources (for example, assets, game data, and developer tools) using secure HTTPS calls supporting JSON payloads. They require API key or OAuth 2.0 authentication and are documented on the Roblox Creator Hub.
- **Engine (In-Game) API:** Accessible from within Roblox Studio via Lua scripting, these APIs allow you to interact with game services (like DataStore, Physics, UI, and more) using Roblox’s native Lua API. They are part of the core engine and subject to capability and sandbox restrictions.

## Using Web and Cloud APIs

### API Authentication and API Keys

- **Authentication Methods:**  
  - Many endpoints require you to authenticate using API keys (provided in a header such as `x-api-key`) or via OAuth 2.0 tokens.  
  - API keys for both individual and group experiences can be generated through the Creator Dashboard. When creating a key, you assign the API system (or systems) you want access to and set the required level of permission (for example, read, write, asset:read, asset:write).
  
- **Rate Limiting:**  
  - Most endpoints (such as those related to assets) have rate limits (for example, 60 requests per 60 seconds per IP address), so your application should properly manage call frequency and handle too-many-requests scenarios.

### Calling Cloud APIs

Roblox’s Open Cloud APIs support RESTful operations over HTTPS. For example, the Assets API lets you upload models, retrieve asset details, list versions, and even archive or restore assets.

**Example: Uploading an Asset**  
A sample cURL call to upload an asset might look like this:

```
curl --location --request POST 'https://apis.roblox.com/assets/v1/assets' \
--header 'x-api-key: {yourApiKey}' \
--form 'request="{
  \"assetType\": \"Model\",
  \"displayName\": \"My Cool Model\",
  \"description\": \"A description of the model.\",
  \"creationContext\": {
    \"creator\": {
      \"userId\": \"{yourUserId}\"
    }
  }
}"' \
--form 'fileContent=@"/path/to/your/model.fbx";type=model/fbx'
```

This request sends both JSON–formatted asset metadata and the model file as multipart form data. Similar endpoints exist to retrieve asset details, list versions, or roll back to a previous version. Detailed documentation (such as the assets API reference) provides payload examples, required parameters, and expected responses.

### Using Legacy API Endpoints

Roblox’s legacy endpoints cover a range of services from catalog searches and account information to user moderation. These endpoints might require the use of Roblox security cookies or specific legacy authentication and documentation notes. Although newer cloud APIs are recommended for new developments, legacy endpoints continue to serve applications where backward compatibility is necessary.

## Using the In-Game (Engine) API

When you are working on your experience inside Roblox Studio, you use the Lua-based Engine API to control game logic and access game services. Key points include:

- **Access via Lua Scripts:**  
  - You call methods like `game:GetService("DataStoreService")` or manipulate instances (objects) directly. These classes and methods are documented extensively in the Roblox Engine API reference.
  
- **Capabilities and Sandbox Restrictions:**  
  - Roblox uses a system of capabilities to restrict what a script can do. For instance, if a script attempts to modify parts of the DataModel that are outside its sandbox, an error will occur indicating a missing capability (e.g., “lacking capability AccessOutsideWrite”).  
  - Capabilities are grouped into areas such as execution control (client or server execution), instance access control (what parts of the hierarchy can be manipulated), script functionality control (what Lua functions can be used), and engine API access control (which engine features can be accessed).

- **Error Handling and Permissions:**  
  - When you try to execute a method that is not permitted by the script’s current capabilities, Roblox will return an error message describing the missing permission. This mechanism ensures that only authorized scripts modify sensitive areas of your experience.

## Best Practices and Considerations

- **Secure Your API Keys:**  
  - Store API keys securely on your server or development environment. Never expose keys directly in client-executed scripts.
  
- **Respect Rate Limits:**  
  - Ensure your code handles rate limit responses gracefully, potentially by implementing exponential backoff or queuing requests.
  
- **Use Standard HTTPS Methods:**  
  - All cloud APIs use HTTPS and common HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE), so familiarity with RESTful communication patterns is essential.
  
- **Monitor API Changes:**  
  - Roblox regularly updates its API endpoints and deprecates old functionality. Keeping up with official documentation and community change feeds (via developer forums) helps ensure your integration continues to work as intended.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  - Both web API responses and engine API errors provide detailed messages. Incorporate robust error handling and logging to manage unexpected issues or missing capabilities.

## Conclusion

The Roblox API ecosystem is both broad and deep, enabling developers to create external tools as well as in-game systems that interact seamlessly with Roblox services. By understanding the differences between Web/Legacy APIs, Cloud APIs, and the Engine API, ensuring proper authentication, and following best practices for secure and efficient API usage, you can build powerful and scalable applications that leverage Roblox’s full feature set. For further details and examples, refer to the official Roblox documentation on the Creator Hub and related API reference materials.

This guide should give you a solid starting point for integrating Roblox’s API into your development workflow while keeping your experience secure and robust.
